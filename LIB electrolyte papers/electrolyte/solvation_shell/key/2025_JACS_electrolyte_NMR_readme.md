This dataset corresponds to the publication "Decoding the Competing Effects of Dynamic Solvation Structures on Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Chemical Shifts of Battery Electrolytes via Machine Learning". It includes DFT-level nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts of ‚Å∑Li in LiFSI/DME solutions for neural network model training. All DFT calculations for the clusters were carried out with Gaussian 16 at the revTPSS/pcSseg-1 level using the polarizable continuum model (PCM) solvation model.
